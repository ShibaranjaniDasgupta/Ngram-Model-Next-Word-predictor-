1. Briefly discuss two most popular reasons of adopting Agile model.  
The Agile model is chosen by many organizations for its ability to work with any requirement and 
deliver value incrementally. Two of the most popular reasons for adopting Agile are: 
1. Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, are flexible in 
responding to changing requirements. By breaking down the project into smaller iterations, teams can 
quickly adjust priorities and take feedback. This allows teams to response to market dynamics and  
customer needs, which lead to faster delivery of high-quality products. 
2. Enhanced Collaboration and Communication: Agile promotes close collaboration among 
cross-functional teams, including developers, testers, designers, and product owners. Regular meetings 
such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, help in communication. This collaborative environment 
encourages team members to share knowledge, take up challenges, and give solutions together. As a 
result, Agile teams often experience improved productivity, and innovation. 
 2.  Briefly describe one situation when Agile is not the best choice of development? 
Agile methods are highly effective in many scenarios, but there are situations where they may not be 
the best choice, such as: 
Highly Regulated Environments: In industries like healthcare, finance, or aerospace where strict 
regulation is important, Agile may not always align perfectly and validation process is required. These 
industries often have tough quality standards that are necessary for advanced planning and 
documentation, which Agile can’t accommodate within it’s nature. In such cases, a more traditional 
waterfall or hybrid approach that focuses on advanced planning and documentation may be better 
suited to ensure regulation. 
3. What is "Scrum Sprint"?  
A Scrum Sprint is a time-boxed iteration within the Scrum framework, lasting between one to four 
weeks. The Sprint provides a focused timeframe for the team to complete a set of prioritized work items 
from the product backlog, which are selected during the Sprint Planning meeting. 
During a Sprint, the team holds daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, identifies pending work, 
and plan the day's work. At the end of the Sprint, the team conducts a Sprint Review to demonstrate the 
completed work  and gather feedback. This is followed by a Sprint Recollection where the team 
identifies areas for improvement. 
4. What do you understand by "Daily Stand-Up" (or "Daily Scrum") ? 
The Daily Scrum, also known as the Daily Stand-up or Daily Stand-up Meeting, is a short, time-boxed 
meeting held by Scrum teams every day during a Sprint. Its primary purpose is to synchronize the 
activities of team members, discuss progress towards the Sprint Goal, and identify any impediments or 
obstacles that need to be addressed.  
The Daily Scrum is typically limited to 15 minutes or less, ensuring that it remains focused and efficient. 
The Daily Scrum helps to ensure that team members are aligned, informed, and empowered to work 
collaboratively towards achieving the Sprint Goal. 
 
 
 
 
5. What is the difference between Waterfall and Agile models? 
 
S.no.  Agile model Waterfall model 
1. Definition Agile model follows the incremental 
approach. 
Waterfall model follows a 
sequential design process. 
2. Progress In the agile model, the measurement 
of progress is in terms of developed 
and delivered functions. 
In the waterfall model, generally 
the measurement of progress is in 
terms of completed and reviewed 
artifacts. 
3. Nature Agile model is flexible as there is a 
possibility of changing the 
requirements even after starting the 
development process. 
The waterfall model is rigid as it 
does not allow to modify the 
requirements once the development 
process starts. 
4. Customer 
interaction 
In Agile model, there is a high 
customer interaction.  
Customer interaction in waterfall 
model is very less.  
5. Team size It has a small team size. The team may consist of more 
members.
